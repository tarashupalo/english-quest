GRAMMAR: 1st Conditional
"If" + present + "will do" = real possibility
If I go to the park tomorrow, I will play football
This sentence means that I think there is a real possibility that I will go to the park tomorrow, and, if I do, I will play football. The construction of the 1st conditional is "If" + present + "will do". It communicates that we think something is a real possibility.
GRAMMAR: 2nd Conditional
"If + past + "would do" = only imagining
If I went to the park tomorrow, I would play football
This sentence means that I think it is very improbable that I will go to the park tomorrow; I am only imagining it. The construction of the 2nd conditional is "If" + past + "would do". It communicates that we are only imagining something. 
It is important to understand that, in the 2nd conditional, we use the past simple after "if", but we are not thinking about past time; we are thinking about now, the future or general time. For example: 
If I had $1 million (now). I would buy a house 
If we went to the cinema tomorrow (future), we would see a film 
If they were American (general time), they would speak English
