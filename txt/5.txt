WORDS: Active and passive voice
WORDS: active, passive
WORDS: subject, object
WORDS: Active voice
WORDS: John broke the window
GRAMMAR: In the sentence "John broke the window", "John" is the subject and "the window" is the object. The verb, "broke", is in the active voice. All the verbs we have practised up to now have been in the active voice. The active voice communicates that the subject is active and it does the action in the sentence.
WORDS: Passive voice
WORDS: The window was broken by John
GRAMMAR: This sentence. "The window was broken by John", has the same meaning, but the subject is now "The window", and the verb, "was broken", is in the passive voice. The passive voice communicates that the subject is passive; it does not do the action; it receives it.
WORDS: "To be" + past participle
OTHER: by
GRAMMAR: We form the passive voice with the verb "to be" and a past participle. The verb "to be" communicates the time, and the past participle says what the action is. We use the word "by" when we want to say who does the action. In the sentence "The window was broken by John", the word "was" tells us that the action happened in the past, the word "broken" tells us the action, and the words "by John" tell us who did the action.
Examples: My car was washed last month. Many computers are made in China. The students will be taught by the teacher.
QUESTION: What does the active voice communicate?
A: The active voice communicates that the subject does the action
QUESTION: What does the passive voice communicate?
A: The passive voice communicates that the subject receives the action
QUESTION: How do we form the passive voice?
A: We form the passive voice with the verb "to be" and a past participle
GRAMMAR: We must remember to put the verb "to be" In the right tense. For example. "John has eaten pasta" becomes "Pasta has been eaten by John". The main problem that learners have with the passive voice is putting the verb 'to be" in the correct tense so as to communicate the time idea that they want to express. They are, for instance, unlikely to be familiar with the word "being", since "to be" is rarely used in the continuous form. In this section, they need to realize that the verb "to be" is in the same form as the verb from the sentence in the active voice.
GRAMMAR: Now I am going to give you a sentence in the active voice, and I want you to put it into the passive voice:
QUESTION: John eats the pasta.
A: The pasta is eaten by John
